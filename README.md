# Data_Bootcamp_Final_Project

This project was completed by Oleksandr Petriv in partial fulfilment of ECON-UB.0232,
Data Bootcamp, Fall 2017. I certify that the NYU Stern Honor Code applies to this project. In
particular, I have:

Clearly acknowledged the work and efforts of others when submitting written work as our own.
The incorporation of the work of others–including but not limited to their ideas, data, creative
expression, and direct quotations (which should be designated with quotation marks), or paraphrasing
thereof– has been fully and appropriately referenced using notations both in the text
and the bibliography.

And I understand that:

Submitting the same or substantially similar work in multiple courses, either in the same semester
or in a different semester, without the express approval of all instructors is strictly forbidden.
I acknowledge that a failure to abide by NYU Stern Honor Code will result in a failing grade for
the project and course.

Project Description

Crowdfunding platforms have increased in popularity for financially supporting innovative project ideas.
These platforms allow creative people to make their own product if there is enough interest from the public (project backers).
For campaign managers who use crowdfunding platforms such as Kickstarter it is vital to understand what key aspects of their campaign could potentially increase the probability of their success. For the sake of clarity, we define the "success" of a project by the percentage of funding received. A successful campaign would be one that received at least 100% of its goal. According to Kickstarter policies (as of 2017), only campaigns that reached at least 100% of their goal will receive the funding. Otherwise, all pledged money will return to campaign backers. In this project we attempt to compare successful and failed Kickstarter campaigns in the United States over the period from 2010 until the end of 2016 through the prism of factors outlined above. In our analysis of Kickstarter's historical data, we strive to identify the key elements that could help a crowdfunding campaign to become successful. Our findings would potentially serve as a guide to maximize the likelihood of a campaign's success for both new and experienced crowdfunding campaign managers. Our data is taken from ks-projects-201612.csv, a dataset posted on Kaggle that includes information on more than 300,000 campaigns posted on Kickstarter during 2010-2016. This project explores the following question: * **How do different factors of a project lead to its success/failure? Do these factors have a common pattern we can recognize and utlize to predict the likelihood of a project's success?**
